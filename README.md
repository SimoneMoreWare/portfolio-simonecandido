## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) — a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email. No backend required.

**How it works:**

1. Sign up at [web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com/) with your email address
2. You receive an **access key** via email
3. The key is placed in a hidden input field inside the form
4. On submit, the form data is sent to the Web3Forms API via `fetch()`
5. Web3Forms forwards the message to your email

**Spam protection:** A hidden honeypot checkbox field (`botcheck`) is included — bots that auto-fill all fields get blocked. Web3Forms also applies server-side rate limiting.

> The access key is safe to expose in public code — it only allows sending emails **to** the registered address, not reading or accessing anything.

## Blog Articles Integration

The portfolio dynamically fetches and displays the latest articles from [moreware.org](https://www.moreware.org/wp/) using the WordPress REST API, which is exposed by default on any WordPress site.

**How it works:**

1. On page load, a `fetch()` call is made to `https://www.moreware.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=6&_embed`
2. The `_embed` parameter includes featured images (thumbnails) in the response
3. The JSON response is parsed and rendered as blog cards with title, date, excerpt, and thumbnail
4. Dates are formatted according to the currently selected language (EN/IT)
5. If the API is unreachable, a fallback message is displayed

**Why this approach:**

- No backend or third-party service required — the WordPress REST API supports CORS out of the box
- No API key needed — the endpoint is public and read-only
- Articles update automatically whenever new content is published on the blog
- The `_embed` parameter avoids extra API calls for media attachments

**Filtering by author:** To show only articles from a specific author, find your author ID via `https://www.moreware.org/wp/wp-json/wp/v2/users?search=simone` and append `&author=ID` to the API URL.

## Quick Start (Local)

Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step, no dependencies to install.
